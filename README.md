# Learning_AI

A repo where I place all the stuff I've written to help me better understand Artificial Intelligence concepts

What I have so far:
- Followed Andrej Karpathys intro to neural networks and backpropagation video, which allowed me to get an intuitive understanding of how neural nets work and how they can be implemented in code. This renforces what I have already learned in my university AI methods class. (micrograd_from_scratch)
- Followed Andrej Karpathys spelled-out intro to language modeling series:
  - Part 1: Basic Bigram counting and the equivalent model using basic single-layer Neural Networks
  - Part 2 (In progress): Multi-layer perceptrons
