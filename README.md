# Learning_AI

A repo where I place all the stuff I've written to help me better understand Artificial Intelligence concepts

What I have so far:
- Followed Andrej Karpathys intro to neural networks and backpropagation video, which allowed me to get an intuitive understanding of how neural nets work and how they can be implemented by reinforcing what I have already learned in my university AI methods class. (micrograd_from_scratch)
